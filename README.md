# ENAsequences Workflow

This repository contains the set of scripts to analyze the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) ‘Nucleotide sequences’ dataset -- understand the characteristics of data and knowledge stored in different LSLOD sources, as well as to understand and quantify the semantic heterogeneity in the LSLOD Sources (excluding the Biomedical Ontologies from BioPortal -- please check the OntoReuse repository for the corresponding scripts related to BioPortal).

This repository is entirely made of R scripts.
